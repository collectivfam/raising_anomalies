    question: "What is your name?",
    answer: "Randy."
  },
  {
    question: "How would you describe yourself?",
    answer: "I'm a husband, father, son, brother ‚Äì the identifiers go on, but I always identify myself in some familial aspect, at the core. <br/><br/>In terms of career, I'm a software developer that cares a lot about eq/ei. Other than that, I love to write, explore hip-hop music, design, and generally just make things.",
  },
  {
    question: "You're a software developer?",
    answer: "Absolutely."
  },
  {
    question: "Oh so you \"write code\", as they say?",
    answer: "I do."
  },
  {
    question: "What sorta things do you make?",
    answer: "I pretty much make random apps or sites, just side-project stuff. I built this site."
  },
  {
    question: "Did you write these questions as well?",
    answer: "Facts."
  },
  {
    question: "How?",
    answer: "Exported an array of objects, each containing a question and answer property with strings as values for both. I wrote the questions and these answers. Then import that module into the view, iterated over the data and rendered a list item with nested spans, dangerously set HTML for each string. Something like that."
  },
  {
    question: "Sounds pretty basic.",
    answer: "Thank you, üôè"
  },
  {
    question: "Okay so moving on ‚Äì can you explain what inspired this book?",
    answer: "Sure. It was a few things. First off, I've always been a writer, it's been that way since I was a kid. It's something I love to do. Check my resume. From elementary up to college, and even post-uni now into my career, I've always loved it. These days I do blogs, mostly.<br/><br/>At some point, I realized that I enjoy writing so much and I wanted to produce so much content, that I figured, 'why not just put it together in a single publication?'<br/><br/>So here we are.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is this your first published book?",
    answer: "It is."
  },
  {
    question: "Congratulations!",
    answer: "I appreciate that, thanks."
  },
  {
    question: "Who would you say this book is for?",
    answer: "My wife and kids."
  },
  {
    question: "No, I mean ‚Äì¬†what audience is your book tailored towards? Like, who would benefit the most from reading this?",
    answer: "Oh, I got you. I'd say these stories are perfect for new or young parents that are beginning to think about how they want to raise their families. I think it's also a great read for couples who find themselves in a tight circumstance and are trying to figure out how to shape their future together.<br/><br/>Cause a lot of the book is about that, right, the struggle to find yourself as a collective unit of a family. That's what this is.<br/><br/>I definitely think it's a good read for young fathers out there. I could also see it being useful for someone trying to pivot their careers ‚Äì it's everything.<br/><br/>Bottom line, if you know me, pick it up. I'm hoping you find it valuable or entertaining at least."
  },
  {
    question: "What's was your writing process like?",
    answer: "First off, I spent about a month researching how other authors approached their own works. I have people in my network who were self-published authors, or, in the process of writing their first book. I picked their brains and tried to understand their journeys. I also began to <em>look at</em> books ‚Äì what I mean by that is, I didn't just read for content, but I began to study other styles or techniques, their organizations, outlines, flow, grids, cover art, and so forth.<br/><br/>I brainstormed with my wife pretty much every night; every conversation was productive and every time we talk, it's an automatic contribution to my writing. Then I established an accountability partner very early on. These initial activities helped me to prepare for the journey.<br/><br/>After that, it was just a matter of creating time and tackling one story at a time.",
  },
  {
    question: "What about the actual writing process? <laughs>",
    answer: "Haha oh yeah! I do most of my writing in early mornings, between the hours of around 1:00 AM and 7:00 AM. This schedule gives me enough time to dive right in, make some edits on the content I last worked on, and get into a flow state."
  },
  {
    question: "Wait, did you just say 1 to 7 AM!??",
    answer: "I did. There's a chapter on that."
  },
  {
    question: "Oh I know, I was just clarifying for the people.",
    answer: "All good."
  },
  {
    question: "Are there any specific writing tools that you use?",
    answer: "I keep my work in a what I called a 'mini log', which was just a small bulleted list that I tracked in a GitHub wiki. I sent my accountability partner a summary of that log, every Friday.<br/><br/>All my drafts were created and kept in Google Docs, which allowed me to compose, edit, and review from anywhere. GitHub and Google Docs, those are the main tools."
  },
  {
    question: "Why don't you have a larger social media presence?",
    answer: "Social media networks and platforms scare me. Every day we hear another story about how our data is being used against people, so my fear is that we're becoming desensitized to what's happening. Other than that, my activity is relatively light on social media just for the simple fact I try to protect my cognitive load ‚Äì I try not to think about too much."
  },
  {
    question: "Can you expand on that a little more?",
    answer: "I've been that way since became a developer. It might be an efficiency thing, where I don't want to overload the mental processors, if that makes sense. You know how when you're running too many apps on your laptop and it starts humming?<br/><br/>The goal is to never have the fan spinning ‚Äì to me that's life telling you you're doing too much.<br/><br/>You gotta clear that cache sometimes."
  },
  {
    question: "I like that. I'm gonna use that.",
    answer: "Feel free."
  },
  {
    question: "I have a set fairly random questions that I wanted to ask you, are you okay with that?",
    answer: "Definitely."
  },
  {
    question: "Top 5 favorite hip-hop artists of all time",
    answer: "I love it. You do know that this is always a controversial topic, right?<br/><br/> Okay, in no particular order: Aesop Rock, Mos Def, Andre 3000, Brother Ali... the fifth is always difficult. Could be Genelec, an independent emcee from years ago. Maybe Oddisee. Even Eminem could be in that list."
  },
  {
    question: "Best fast food chain?",
    answer: "Taco Bell, no question."
  },
  {
    question: "In my spare time, I like to...",
    answer: "Go on \"family dates\" with my wife and kids, hang out with the Husky, make art... watch battle rap. And take naps."
  },
  {
    question: "Your spirit animal is...",
    answer: "A wolf."
  },
  {
    question: "Favorite movie?",
    answer: "I don't really watch movies. Maybe Fire in the Sky, that Travis Walton alien abduction story."
  },
  {
    question: "Favorite television series?",
    answer: "Project Bluebook."
  },
  {
    question: "What keeps you up at night?",
    answer: "I want to leave a healthy legacy for our sons to look back on, that's the main reason why I do all of this.<br/><br/>When I wake up in the middle of the night, there's always a looming list of things I want to accomplish ‚Äì topics I want to write about or some solution to a problem that I want to build and share with the world.<br/><br/>All these ideas need that time and attention, so I get up."
  },
  {
    question: "Last question. One thing that most people don't know about you?",
    answer: "All my t-shirts are from Walmart."
  },
  {
    question: "Lol are you serious?",
    answer: "I am!<br/><br/>Well, I might have an Amazon Essentials one, but it fits weird.<br/><br/>Anyway, shout out to Walmart blank tees. ‚úä "
  },
  {
    question: "What can your audience expect next from you?",
    answer: "So I plan to continue writing, although I can't say that I have another book in the works, yet! I do have several ideas of some interesting platforms that I want to pursue, and I also have a couple of problem spaces that I'd love to navigate through. How that all manifests is yet to be determined.<br/><br/>Right now, I'm in heavy exploration mode, which is exciting going into 2020. Every day my wife and I discuss and review potential projects, so we'll see what happens."
  },
  {
    question: "That's great to hear. You have any last words for your audience?",
    answer: "God bless y'all, thank you, and always remember to think outside the self."
  },
  {
    question: "And where can people contact you?",
    answer: "My <a href='/contact'>contact</a> page."
  },
  {
    question: "Perfect. Well thank you, Randy, for this Q&A. This was fun.",
    answer: "Have a good day. Easy."
