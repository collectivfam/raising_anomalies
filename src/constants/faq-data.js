    question: "What is your name?",
    answer: "Randy."
  },
  {
    question: "How would you describe yourself?",
    answer: "I'm a husband, father, son, brother ‚Äì the labels go on, but I always identify myself in some familial aspect, at the core. In terms of career, I'm a software developer that cares a lot about eq/ei. Other than that, I love to write, explore hip-hop music in our home studio, design, and generally just make things.",
  },
  {
    question: "You're a software developer?",
    answer: "Absolutely."
  },
  {
    question: "Oh so you \"write code\", as they say?",
    answer: "I do."
  },
  {
    question: "What sorta things do you make?",
    answer: "Apps, sites, side-projects. I built this site."
  },
  {
    question: "And you write these questions as well?",
    answer: "Facts."
  },
  {
    question: "How?",
    answer: "Exported an array of objects, each containing a question and answer property with strings as values for both. I wrote the questions and these answers. Then import that module into the view, iterated over the data and rendered a list item with nested spans, dangerously set HTML for each string. Something like that."
  },
  {
    question: "Sounds pretty basic.",
    answer: "Thank you, üôè"
  },
  {
    question: "Okay so moving on ‚Äì can you explain what inspired this book?",
    answer: "Sure. It was a few things. First off, I've always been a writer, it's been that way since I was a kid. Check my resume: elementary, middle, high school, college, and career, always loved it. These days I do blogs mostly.<br/><br/>At some point, I realized that I enjoy writing so much and I wanted to put out so much content, that I figured, 'why not just put it together in a single publication?'<br/><br/>So here we are.",
  },
  {
    question: "What's was your writing process like?",
    answer: "First off, I spent about a month researching how other authors approached their own works. I have people in my network who were self-published authors, or, in the process of writing their first book. I picked their brains and tried to understand their journeys. I also began to <em>look at</em> books ‚Äì what I mean by that is, I didn't just read for content, but I began to study other author's styles, organizations, outlines, flow, and so forth.<br/><br/>I brainstormed with my wife pretty much every night; every conversation was productive. I also established an accountability partner very early on. These initial activities helped me to prepare for the journey.<br/><br/>After that, it was just a matter of creating time and tackling one story at a time.",
  },
  {
    question: "What about the actual writing process? <laughs>",
    answer: "Haha oh yeah! I do most of my writing in early mornings, between the hours of around 1:00 AM and 7:00 AM. This schedule gives me enough time to dive right in, make some edits on the content I last worked on, and get into a flow state."
  },
  {
    question: "Are there any specific tools that you use?",
    answer: "I keep my work in a what I called a 'mini log', which was just a small bulleted list that I tracked in a GitHub wiki. I sent my accountability partner a summary of that log, every Friday.<br/><br/>All my drafts were created and kept in Google Docs, which allowed me to compose, edit, and review from anywhere. GitHub and Google Docs, those are the main tools."
  },
  {
    question: "Why don't you have a larger social media presence?",
    answer: "Social media networks and platforms scare me. Every day we hear another story about how our data is being used against people, so my fear is that we're becoming desensitized to what's happening. Other than that, my activity is relatively light on social media just for the simple fact I try to protect my cognitive load ‚Äì I don't like to think about too much."
  },
  {
    question: "I have a set fairly random questions that I wanted to ask you, are you okay with that?",
    answer: "Definitely."
  },
  {
    question: "Top 5 favorite hip-hop artists of all time",
    answer: "I love it. You do know that this is always a controversial topic, right?<br/><br/> Okay, in no particular order: Aesop Rock, Mos Def, Andre 3000, Brother Ali... the fifth is always difficult. I'd say Lauryn Hill."
  },
  {
    question: "Best fast food chain?",
    answer: "Taco Bell, no question."
  },
  {
    question: "In my spare time, I like to...",
    answer: "Go on \"family dates\" with my wife and kids, hang out with the Husky, make art... watch battle rap. And take naps."
  },
  {
    question: "Your spirit animal is...",
    answer: "A wolf."
  },
  {
    question: "Favorite movie?",
    answer: "I don't really watch movies. Maybe Fire in the Sky, that Travis Walton alien abduction story."
  },
  {
    question: "Favorite television series?",
    answer: "Project Bluebook."
  },
  {
    question: "Last question. One thing that most people don't know about you?",
    answer: "All my t-shirts are from Walmart."
  },
  {
    question: "Lol are you serious?",
    answer: "Yeah! Okay I might have an Amazon Essentials one, but it fits weird. Anyway, shout out to Walmart blank tees. ‚úä "
  },
  {
    question: "What can your audience expect next from you?",
    answer: "So I plan to continue writing, although I can't say that I have another book in the works, yet! I do have several ideas of some interesting platforms that I want to pursue, and I also have a couple of problem spaces that I'd love to navigate through. How that all manifests is yet to be determined.<br/><br/>Right now, I'm in heavy exploration mode, which is exciting going into 2020. Every day my wife and I discuss and review potential projects, so we'll see what happens."
  },
  {
    question: "That's great to hear. You have any last words for your audience?",
    answer: "God bless y'all, thank you, and always remember to think outside the self."
  },
  {
    question: "And where can people contact you?",
    answer: "My <a href='/contact'>contact</a> page."
  },
  {
    question: "Perfect. Well thank you, Randy, for this Q&A. This was fun.",
    answer: "Have a good day. Easy."
