    question: "What is your name?",
    answer: "Randy."
  },
  {
    question: "How would you describe yourself?",
    answer: "I'm a husband, father, son, brother ‚Äì the labels go on, but I always identify myself in some familial aspect, at the core. In terms of career, I'm a software developer that cares a lot about eq/ei. Other than that, I love to write, explore hip hop music in our home studio, design, and generally just make things.",
  },
  {
    question: "You're a software developer?",
    answer: "Absolutely."
  },
  {
    question: "So do you \"write code\" as they say?",
    answer: "What the... yes."
  },
  {
    question: "What do you do with that code?",
    answer: "Build apps, artifacts, side-projects. I mean, I built this site."
  },
  {
    question: "Did you write these questions as well?",
    answer: "Facts."
  },
  {
    question: "How?",
    answer: "Bro, I exported an array of objects, each containing a question and answer property with strings as values for both. I wrote the questions and these answers. Then import that module into the view, iterated over the data and rendered a list item with nested spans, dangerously set HTML for each string. Something like that."
  },
  {
    question: "Okay, I believe you.",
    answer: "Thank you, üôè"
  },
  {
    question: "Okay so moving on ‚Äì can you explain what inspired this book?",
    answer: "Sure. It was a few things. First off, I've always been a writer, it's been that way since I was a kid. Check my resume: elementary, middle, high school, college, and career, always loved it. These days I do blogs mostly.<br/><br/>At some point, I realized that I enjoy writing so much and I wanted to put out so much content, that I figured, 'why not just put it together in a single publication?'<br/><br/>So here we are.",
  },
  {
    question: "What's was your writing process like?",
    answer: "First off, I spent about a month researching how other authors approached their own works. I have people in my network who were self-published authors, or, in the process of writing their first book. I picked their brains and tried to understand their journeys. I also began to <em>look at</em> books ‚Äì what I mean by that is, I didn't just read for content, but I began to study other author's styles, organizations, outlines, flow, and so forth.<br/><br/>I brainstormed with my wife pretty much every night; every conversation was productive. I also established an accountability partner very early on. These initial activities helped me to prepare for the journey.<br/><br/>After that, it was just a matter of creating time and tackling one story at a time.",
  },
  {
    question: "Are there any specific tools that you use?",
    answer: "I track my work in a what I called a 'mini log', which was just a small bulleted list that I tracked in a GitHub wiki. I sent my accountability partner a summary of that log, every Friday.<br/><br/>All my drafts were created and kept in Google Docs, which allowed me to compose, edit, and review from anywhere. "
  },
  {
    question: "Why don't you have a larger social media presence?",
    answer: "Social media networks and platforms scare me. Every day we hear another story about how our data is being used against us, and my fear is that people are just desensitized to what's happening. Other than that, my activity is relatively light on social media just for the simple fact I try to protect my cognitive load ‚Äì I don't like to think about too much."
  },
  {
    question: "What's next?",
    answer: "I plan to continue writing ‚Äì I can't say that I another book in the works, yet, but I do have an idea of a couple of problems that I'd love to navigate through writing, but how that manifests is yet to be determined.<br/><br/>I'm in heavy exploration mode right now, which is exciting going into 2020. Every day me and my wife discuss and review potential projects, so we'll see what happens."
  },
  {
    question: "Fantastic. Any last words for your audience?",
    answer: "God bless y'all, thank you, and always remember to think outside the self."
  },
  {
    question: "And where can people contact you?",
    answer: "My contact page."
  },
  {
    question: "Oh right ‚Äì perfect. Well thank you, Randy, for this Q&A. This was fun.",
    answer: "Have a good day. Easy."
